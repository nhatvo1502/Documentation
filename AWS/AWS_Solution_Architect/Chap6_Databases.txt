    1. Relastional databases on AWS
        Supported DB:
            -> SQL Server
            -> Oracle
            -> MySQL Server (what we use for this lab)
            -> PostgreSQL
            -> Aurora
            -> MariaDB
        Types: Multiple AZs vs Read Replicas
            - Multi-AZ 
                -> Disaster Recovery for HA DB
                -> Good for important DB
                -> Failover automatically:
                    + EC2 connect to Primary DB via connecting DNS string 
                    + When Primary DB is down, AWS will automatically create/update another connecting DNS string from EC2 to 
                        the Secondary DB
            - Read Replicas 
                -> Performance DB
                -> Good for DB has huge read requests
                -> Failover isn't auto:
                    + EC2 connect to Primary DB via connecting DNS string 
                    + When Primary is down, user have to create new URL + manually update DNS on Read Replicas DB
    2. Non Relational Databases
        -> 
    3. Relational DB vs Non-relational DB
    4. Data Warehousing
        -> use for Business Intelligence BI
        -> use to pull in large complex data sets
        -> for management do queries on data
        Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) vs Online Analytics Processing (OLAP)
            OLTP:
                -> small, specific query
                -> contain specific product ID, personal info, etc.
            OLAP:
                -> big, complex number of queries
                -> pull in large number of records
        -> use different type of Architecture both from database perspective and infrastructure Layer
        -> AWS Redshift

RDS
    -> runs on virtual machines
    -> cannot ssh (or remoting)
    -> cannot login to patching (AWS responsibility)
    -> RDS is serverless

RDS Backups - Automated Backups vs Database snapshots
    Automated Backups:
        -> allow to recover db to any point in time within Retention Period
        -> Retention Period 1-35 days
        -> How:
            -> Automated Backups take: full daily snapshots + store daily transaction logs
            -> recover: choose the most recent daily backup -> apple transaction logs 
        -> allow to recover a point in time recovery down to a second
        -> enable by default
        -> backups store in S3 for free
        -> S3 size = DB size
        -> during backups, I/O may suspend or elevated latency
    Snapshots
        -> manual
        -> save after DB is deleted
        -> restore DB from snapshot will be restored on different endpoint
