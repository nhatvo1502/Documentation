Organization and Account
    Organization: manage billing, control access, compliance,security,
        share resources accross AWS accounts
    Root account (only 1, master) vs accounts
    Organization Unit
    Service Control Policies

AWS Networking
    Internet > AWS Account > Region > VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) > 
        AZ > Subnet (Public/Private) > Instance
    Internet Gate Way (Access internet)
    Route Table (termine network traffics directed)
    Security Group (Instance lvl) vs NACLs (Subnet lvl)

Database Services
    DynamoDB -NoSQL key/value database (cassandra)
    DocumentDB -NoSQL Document (mongoDB compatible)
    RDS -Support multiple engines: MySQL, Postgres, Maria DB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL server, Aurora
        Aurora: fast, replicated multiple AZs, fully managed
        Aurora serverless - only run when needed (Lambda)
    Neptune -graph DB
    Redshift - Columnar DB, petabyte warehouse
    Elasticase -Redis/Memcached DB

Provivioning easy way to automated determine resource and setup instance using code or GUI
    Elastic Beanstalk
    OpsWorks
    CloudFormation
    AWS QuickStart
    AWS MarketPlace

Computing
    EC2 Elastic Computer Cloud
    ECS vs EKS:
        ECS - Elastic Container Service, Manage Docker image, free, light
        EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Service, Manage Kubernetes service, pay, complex
    Fargate serverless way to launch containers (Docker/Kubernetes)
        Automatically evaluate needed resource for an image, spin a EC2, launch the image
        No Provisioning needed
        On demand
        pay only for what resource use (pay for how long, how much capacity)
        Easily scapes up and down
    Lambda Serverless functions to run code without Provisioning
    Elastic Beanstalk orchestrates AWS services; EC2, S3,  etc to scale up and down Automatically upon the growth of the image/container inside
    AWS Batch launch EC2 use spot instances to save money

Storage
    S3 Simple Storage Service - object Storage
    S3 Glacier - low cost, cold data, take longer to access, charge per retrieve
    Storage Gateway - gateway to cloud from prem (File gate way, Volume Gateway, tape gateway)
    EBS Elastic Block Storage - cloud hard drive, attach to 1 EC2 instance one at a time
    EFS Elastic File Storage - cloud hard drive, attach to multiple EC2 at the same time
    Snowball:
        Snowball - Physically migrate lots of date via a computer suite 50-80TB
        Snowball Edge - better version 100TB
        Snowmobile - shipping container on a trailer truck, 100PB

    Amazon Connect - Call Center service
    WorkSpaces - Virtual Remote Desktop
        DaaS (Desktop-as-a-Service)
        VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)

Enterprise Integration (going hybrid)
    Direct Connect - dedicated Giga virtual fibre optic to AWS
    VPN
        Site-to-site VPN - connect on-prem to AWS
        Client VPN - connect off-prem to AWS
    Storage Gateway - hybrid service to connect on-prem storage to AWS cloud storage for: backup, archiving,
        disaster recovery, cloud data process, storage tiering, and migration
    Active Directory - Microsoft AD managed by AWS
   
Logging Services
    CloudTrail - logs all API calls (SDK, CLI) betweens AWS services (who can we blame)
        Who created what
        Who to blame
        Automate responses
    CloudWatch 
        CloudWatch Logs - logs storage for AWS services: CPU ultilization, memory, etc.
        CloudWatch Metrics - present time-ordered set of data points to monitor
