Bad Actors
    -> NACL to block IP address (layer 4)
    -> Host-based firewall - run on EC2
    -> ALB will terminate bad IP before NACL 
    -> WAF - Web Application Firewall attached to ALB (layer 7)
        + block or allow IP address
        + sql injection
    -> Can also attach WAF to CloudFront
        + because NACL is sit behind CloudFront, where CloudFront will send different IP (not origin IP)
    -> CloudFront Geo Match

KMS - Key Management Service - key management + encryption + decryption
-> Regional
-> Customer master keys (CMKs)
-> S3 objects, databases password, API keys
-> encrypt/decrypt data up to 4KB
-> pay per API call
-> audit with CloudTrail
-> FIPS 140-2 level 2
-> HSM level 3
