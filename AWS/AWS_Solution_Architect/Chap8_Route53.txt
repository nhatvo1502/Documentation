Route53 name explained:
    -> The very first US interstate was route 66. 
        DNS is on port 53 so AWS name it Route 53

======
DNS 101
    What is DNS?
        -> Domain Name Service
        -> Convert human friendly domain name to Internet Protocol IP

    IPv4 vs IPv6:
        -> IPv4: 32 bit field and has over 4 billion different addresses
            -> 4,294,967,296
            -> is running out
        -> IPv6: 128 bits
            -> 340 undecillion addresses
            -> created to solve ipv4 problem
    
    Top Level Domains:
        -> Domain Structure: DOMAINNAME.SecondLevelDOMAINNAME.TopLevelDomain
            Ex: Google.com, BBC.co.uk
        -> Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA): controlled Top Level Domains

    Domain Registrars:
        -> Domain name has to be unique
        -> Domain registrars is an authority that can assign domain names directly 
            under one or more top level domains
        -> InterNIC (Internet's Network Information Center), a service of ICANN, enforces uniqueness of domain names across
            Internet
        -> WhoIS database

    Start Of Authority Record (SOA)
        -> stores information about:
            + name of the server that supplied the data for the zone
            + adminstrator of the zone
            + current version fo the data file
            + default number of seconds for the time-to-live TTL file of resource records
    
    Name Server Records (NS Records)
        -> use Top Level Domain servers to direct traffice to Content DNS server
        -> Content DNS server contains the authoritative DNS records

        ======================================================================
        user query: -->  TLD (.com) queries            -> NS Records -> SOA
        google.com       authoritative DNS record:
                         I need to know the ip address

        NS Records contains: 
            A records -  a stand for address
                for example: google.com -> http://8.8.8.8
            CName - Canonical Name
                a reference DNS to point one DNS to another DNS
                for example: www.cat.com -> feline.com -> http://8.8.8.8
                use case: when apply ip change on feline.com, www.cat.com will automaticall follow
                Can't be used with naked domain name (has to have www.)
            Alias Records:
                Alias records are used to map resource record sets in host zone to ELB, CloudFront distribution, or S3 that are configured as Websites
                Similar to CNAME but can be used with naked domain name (without 'www.')


        


    TTL
        -> DNS record is cached on the Resolving Server/local PC during TTL period
        -> flushdns will renew this record
        -> DNS records be default is 48 hours -> any changes to DNS will takes effect
            on client within 48 hours

Route53 Exam Tips:
-> ELBs do not have pre-defined IPv4 addresses; resolve using DNS name
-> Alias Record vs CNAME (naked domain name www.)
-> Common DNS types 
    1. SOA Records
    2. NS Records
    3. A Records
    4. CNAMES
    5. MX Records (mail)
    6. PTR Records (reverser A records: looking up DNS name using IP address)
