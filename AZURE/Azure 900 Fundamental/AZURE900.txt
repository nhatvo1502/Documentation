    Scalability: ability to grow rapidly
        High scalability

        Scaling out = add more servers at the same size

    Elasticity: ability to shrink and grow traffic, memory, and computing power to meet the demand
        High Elasticity

Dedicated -> VMs -> Containers -> Functions
    Dedicated = bare metal
    VM:

    Containers:
        virtual machine running multiple Containers
        Docker Deamon is the name of the software layer that lets you run multiple Containers
    Functions:
        Definition: piece of code running inside a docker/vm
        Good: user responsobile for code and data, cost effective, pay as the code run
        Bad: Cold Start 

Glabal Infrastructure - Regions and Geographies
    Region is a grouping of multiple datacenters (AZ)
        58 Regions across 140 countries
    Geography is discreet market of two or more regions that preserves data residency and compliance boudaries
        Data will stay within that Geography. EG: US government will use USA Geography instead of Region.
        Azure Geographies:
            United States
            Azure Government US
            Canada
            Brazil
            Mexico

    Paired Regions: 
        paired with another region 300 miles away
        only one region is updated at a time to ensure no outages
        Some Azure Services reply on this for DR. EG: Azure Geo-redundant Storage GRS repliaces data to a secondary
            region automatically
    
    Region Types and Service Availability:
        Not all Azure servers are available in every Region
        Recommended region: provide broadest range of services
        Alternate (other) region: extends of Azure's footprint from Recommended Region. Not support AZs
        General availability (GA): a service is ready to be used publicly by everyone
        
        Azure Cloud serivce three categories:
            1. Foundational. When GA, immediately in 12 months in Recommended and Alternate
            2. Mainstream. When GA, immediately or in 12 mo in Recommended only
            3. Specialized. Available in Recommended or Alternate Region based on customer demand

    Special Regions:
        Azure has specialized regions to meet compliance or legal reasons
        US DoD Central (Department of Defense)
        US Gov Virginia
        US Gov Iowa
        (secret locations undisclosed)
        China East
        China North
        (available through unique relation with 21Vianet.com)

    Availability Zone (AZ) = Physical location made up one or more datacenters
        A region will generally contain 3 AZ
        Datacenter within region will be isolate, close enough for low-latency
        Common practice is running 3 AZ for HA

    AZ Supported Region:
        Alternate/Other = doesn't support AZs
        Recommended suppose to have at least 3 AZs
            Central US
            East US 2
            West US 2
            West Europe
            France Central
            North Europe
            Southeast Asia

        Fault Domain = a logical grouping of hardware to avoid a single point of failure in an AZ

        Update Domain = a secondary domain to run resource from in case Azure update  one domain, 
            no 2 domain update at the same time
        Availability Set = local grouping of differet fault/update domain to run VM from to avoid downtime
