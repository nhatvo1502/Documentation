    1. Relastional databases on AWS
        -> SQL Server
        -> Oracle
        -> MySQL Server (what we use for this lab)
        -> PostgreSQL
        -> Aurora
        -> MariaDB

        Key features:
            - Multi-AZ 
                -> Disaster Recovery for HA DB
                -> Good for important DB
                -> Failover automatically:
                    + EC2 connect to Primary DB via connecting DNS string 
                    + When Primary DB is down, AWS will automatically create/update another connecting DNS string from EC2 to 
                        the Secondary DB
            - Read Replicas 
                -> Performance DB
                -> Good for DB has huge read requests
                -> Failover isn't auto:
                    + EC2 connect to Primary DB via connecting DNS string 
                    + When Primary is down, user have to create new URL + manually update DNS on Read Replicas DB
    2. Non Relational Databases
        -> 
    3. Relational DB vs Non-relational DB
    4. Data Warehousing
        -> use for Business Intelligence BI
        -> use to pull in large complex data sets
        -> for management do queries on data
        Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) vs Online Analytics Processing (OLAP)
            OLTP:
                -> small, specific query
                -> contain specific product ID, personal info, etc.
            OLAP:
                -> big, complex number of queries
                -> pull in large number of records
        -> use different type of Architecture both from database perspective and infrastructure Layer
        -> AWS Redshift
