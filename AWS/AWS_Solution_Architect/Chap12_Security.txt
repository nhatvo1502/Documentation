Bad Actors
    -> NACL to block IP address (layer 4)
    -> Host-based firewall - run on EC2
    -> ALB will terminate bad IP before NACL 
    -> WAF - Web Application Firewall attached to ALB (layer 7)
        + block or allow IP address
        + sql injection
    -> Can also attach WAF to CloudFront
        + because NACL is sit behind CloudFront, where CloudFront will send different IP (not origin IP)
    -> CloudFront Geo Match

KMS - Key Management Service - key management + encryption + decryption
-> Regional
-> Customer master keys (CMKs)
-> S3 objects, databases password, API keys
-> encrypt/decrypt data up to 4KB
-> pay per API call
-> audit with CloudTrail
-> FIPS 140-2 level 2
-> HSM level 3

        AWS service integrated with KMS         Download public key to use outside AWS
        Import your own key material            AWS services integrated with KMS do not support asymmetric CMKs

CloudHSM
-> Dedicated hardware security module HSM
-> FIPS140-2 Level 3
-> Level 2 is KMS
-> Manage your own keys
-> No access to the AWS-managed component.
-> Run within a VPC
-> Single tenant, dedicated hardware, multi-AZ cluster
-> Industry-standard APIs- no AWS API
-> PKCS#11
-> Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE)
-> Microsoft CryptoNG (CNG)

EXAM TIPS
-> USE HSM IF:
    -> Regulatory compliance requirements
    -> FIPS 140-2 Level 3
