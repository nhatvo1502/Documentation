VPC - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud 
    - provision a logically isolated section of AWS Cloud
    - a private user defined network
    - user have complete control over this private network: private IP address rage, subnets, route tables and network gateways

    Private IP address:
        -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
        -> 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)
        -> 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)
    
    Default VS vs Custom VPC
        -> Default VPC is user friendly
        -> All submets in default VPC have a route to internet
        -> EC2 instance has both public and private IP address
    
    VPC Peering - to connect one VPC to another
        -> instance behave as if they were on the same private network
        -> can peer with other AWS account VPC
        -> NO TRANSITIVE PEERING! - no brigding. FOr example:
            A <---> B, B <---> C: B can talk to A and C, but A cannot talk to C and likewise

EXAM TIPS:
-> VPC is logical datacenter in AWS
-> Consist of Internet Gateways (IGWs), Route Tables, Network Access Control Lists, Subnets, and Security Groups
-> 1 Subnet = 1 AZ
-> Security Groups are Stateful, Network Access Control Lists are Stateless
-> NO TRANSITIVE PEERING

LAB PART 1
-> Reserved IPaddress - when creating a new subnets
    10.0.0.0: network address
    10.0.0.1: for VPC router
    10.0.0.2: DNS server
    10.0.0.3: for future use
    10.0.0.255: network broadcast address, AWS doesn't support broad cast in VPC, therefore AWS reserve this address
-> A new VPC comes with: default Route Table (main), Network Access Control List (NACL), default Security Groups
-> A new VPC won't create: Subnets, IGW
-> AZs are randomized

LAB PART2

LAB Part3
-> NAT: Network Address Transmission
-> NAT Gateway
    + Redundant inside AZ
    + Prefered by the enterprise
    + 5Gbps - 45Gbps
-> NAT Instance 
    + disable source/destination check on the instance
    + must be on public subnet
