Load Balancer
    -> Balance load between instance 
    1. Application Load Balancer:
        -> HTTP. HTTPD traffic
        -> operate layer 7
    2. Network Load Balancer:
        -> TCP traffic
        -> operate layer 4
        -> extreme performance require

    3. Classic Load Balancers
        -> Legacy Elastic Load Balancer
        -> Layer 7 http/https
        -> Layer 4 on application use TCP
