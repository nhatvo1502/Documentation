Lamda
    Event-driven: trigger response to events
    Compute service: response to HTTP requests via Amazon API Gateway

    Supported Language:
    1. Node.js
    2, Java
    3. Python
    4. C#
    5. Geo
    6. PowerShell

    Price:
    -> Free for first 1 million request. $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter
    -> Duration

-> NO SERVER! = no patching, no virus
-> continous scaling (out not up)
-> SUPER SUPER CHEAP!
-> Lambda <--> Alexa
-> 1 event = 1 function
-> Lambda function can trigger other lambda functions
-> AWS X-ray debug lambda

Serverless Application Model (SAM)
    -> CloudFormation extension optimized for serverless applications
    -> functions, APIs, tables
    -> support anything CloudFormation supports
    -> run serverless applications locally
    -> package and deploy using code-deploy

Elastic Container Service (ECS)
    What is container?
        -> is a package that contains an application, libraries, runtime, and tools required to run it
        -> run on a container engine like Docker
        ->  provides the isolation benefits of virtualization with less overhead and faster starts than VMs
        -> containerized applications are portable and offer a consistent environment
    What is ECS?
        -> manage container orchestration service
        -> create clusters to manage fleets of container deployments
        -> ECS manages EC2 or Fargate instances
        -> schedules containers for optimal placement
        -> defines rules for CPU and memory requirements
        -> monitors resource utilization
        -> deploy, update, roll back containers
        -> FREE
        -> VPC, security groups, EBS volumes
        -> ELB
        -> CloudTrail and CloudWatch
    Components:
        1. Cluster:
            Logical collection of ECS resources - either ECS EC2 instances or Fargate instances
   
        2. Task Definition
            Defines your application. Similar to a Dockerfile but for running containers in ECS. Can contain multiple containers

        3. Container Definition
            Inside a task definition, it defines the individual containers a task uses. Controls CPU and RAM allocation and port mappings

        4. Task
            Single  running copy of any containers defined by a task definition. One working copy of an application

        5. Service
            Allows task definition to be scaled by adding tasks. Defines minimum and maximum values

        6. Registry 
            Storage for container images (ECR Elastic Container Registry or Docker Hub). Used to download images to create containers

Fargate
-> serverless container engine
-> Eliminates need to provision and manage serverless
-> specify and pay for resources per application
-> Works with both ECS and EKS
-> Each workload runs in its own kernel
-> isolation and security
-> Choose EC2 instead if:
    + Compliance requirements
    + Require broader customization
    + require GPUs

EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Service
-> K8s is open source software that lets yo deploy and manage containerized application scaled
-> Same toolset on prem and in CloudFormation
-> containers are group in Pods
-> like ECS, support both EC2 and Fargate
-> Why use EKS?
    + already using K8s
    + want to migrate to AWS

ECR - Elaster Container Registry
-> managed Docker container Registry
-> store, manage, and deploy images
-> integrated with ECS and EKS
-> works with on-prem deployments
-> high available
-> integrate with images
-> pay for storage and data transfer

ECS + ELB = ♥
-> distributed traffic evenly across tasks in your service
-> support ALB, NLB, CLB
-> use ALB to route HTTP/HTTPS layer 7 traffic
-> use NLB or CLB to route TCP layer 4 traffic
-> support by both EC2 and Fargate launch types
-> ALB allows:
    + Dynamic host port mappings
    + Path-based routing
    + priority rules
-> ALB is recommended over NLB or CLB
