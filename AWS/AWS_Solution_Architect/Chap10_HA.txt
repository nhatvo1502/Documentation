Load Balancer
    -> Balance load between instance 
    1. Application Load Balancer:
        -> HTTP. HTTPD traffic
        -> operate layer 7
    2. Network Load Balancer:
        -> TCP traffic
        -> operate layer 4
        -> extreme performance require
        -> millions of requests per second, ultra-low latencies
    3. Classic Load Balancers
        -> Legacy Elastic Load Balancer
        -> Layer 7 http/https
        -> Layer 4 on application use TCP
        -> Not application aware
        -> Error 504: Gateway timeout

X-Forwarded-For Header
                Load Balancer
    User's IP ----------------> Load Balancer's IP
    -> X-Forwarded-For Header will help retrieving User's IP after it pass Load Balancer to the Application

Sticky Session: send users traffic to one EC2 instance only

Cross Zone Load Balancing: Load Balancer can talk to each other and send traffic to each other's instances

Path Patterns: listener with rules to forwards requests based on URL Path
    -> forward www.myurl.com to instance A, B, C, D
    -> forward www.myurl.com/image to instance E, F

Auto Scaling
    -> 3 Components:
        1. Groups: logical component. Webserver group/Application Group/Database group/Application
        2. Configuration Templates: 
        3. Scaling Options:
            + Maintain current instance levels at all time
            + Scale manually
            + Scale base on schedule
            + Scale based on demand (base on resouce, workload, traffic)
            + Predictive scaling (predict on last performance)
